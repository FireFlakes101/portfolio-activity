Artificial intelligence can dramatically improve the efficiencies of our workplaces and<br>
can augment the work humans can do.When AI takes over repetitive or dangerous tasks, it frees up<br> 
the humanworkforce to do work they are better equipped for—tasks that involve creativity<br>
and empathy among others.If people are doing work that is more engaging for them,<br>
it could increase happiness and job satisfaction.

With better monitoring and diagnostic capabilities, artificial intelligence can dramatically<br>
influence healthcare. By improving the operations of healthcare facilities and medical<br>  
organisations,AI can reduce operating costs and save money. One estimate from McKinsey<br>
predicts big data could save medicine and pharma up to $100B annually.<br>
The true impact will be in the care of patients.Potential for personalised treatment plans<br>
and drug protocols as well as giving providers better access to information across medical<br> 
facilities to help inform patient care will be life-changing.

Our society will gain countless hours of productivity with just the introduction of autonomous <br>
transportationand AI influencing our traffic congestion issues not to mention the other ways it<br> 
will improve on-the-job productivity. Freed up from stressful commutes, humans will be able<br> 
to spend their time in a variety of other ways.
